                <h6>eCommerce Solutions for Small Business</h6>
                <p>
                    When entrepreneurs move online, they establish themselves on a level playing field with larger competitors. On the internet, even the smallest online retailer can be as attractive and as functional as the largest big box store without the need to have a physical presence on every street corner. Often, small shops project a "boutique" feel that attracts shoppers, who perceive smaller businesses as more distinctive than larger stores.

                <h6>Business Card Websites</h6>
                <p>
                    The site is essentially a simple, single or up to five page design, that displays personal information, contact details and links through to other social profiles, much like a traditional tactile business card is used to display basic information.
